# Pet-Project: Find your shoe size version 1.0

## Description
This application allows a user to check the user's shoe sizes in different countries. Currently, the United States / Canada, United Kingdom, and Japan are available.

Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Challenges
One of the challenges was to highlight the selected row. When a user selects their size, highlight the selected size of the row. If another size is chosen, remove the highlight from the previous row and add the highlight to the new row. 

## How I solved the challenges
I used .selectedIndex to get the selected size and add a highlight to it. Also, I created a for loop to check if there is already highlighted row in the table and remove the highlight if there is.

## Future updates
Because of my skills at the time when I created this application, I wasn't familiar with AJAX or XML yet. Currently, all data is hardcoded in HTML. I would like to learn what is the best way to display result data in this kind of application.
